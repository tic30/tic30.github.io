# My portfolio website

## Development

### Run
---
This is a React webapp written in TypeScript. You need `node 14` to run it. Start up local dev server with

```
git checkout ts-refactor
npm install
npm start
```

### Eslint
---
Eslint is not enforced to compile or at run time, but is availble. You can run it and apply autofix with
```
npm run lint:fix
```

### Host
---
This page is hosted on GitHub Pages. To redeploy, run
```
npm run deploy
```
which bundles current local files and pushs to `gh-pages` branch. The website will reflect the change after a short delay. DO NOT manually modify `gh-pages` branch.
